        <h1>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH </h1>
        <h3>The Sickness of Timothy Frisby</h3>
        <h5>by Robert C. O'Brien, written in 1971</h5>

 
 

<div class="op">
    Mrs Frisby, the head of a family of field mice, lived in an underground house in the vegetable <br />
garden of a farmer named Mr Fitzgibbon. It was a winter house, such as some field mice move to<br />
when food becomes too scarce, and the living too hard in the woods and pastures. In the soft <br />
earth of a bean, potato, pea and asparagus patch there is plenty of food left over for mice after<br />
the human crop has been gathered.

<br />

<div class="p2">
Mrs Frisby and her family were especially lucky in the house itself. It was a slightly damaged block, the<br />
hollow kind with two oval holes through it; it had somehow been abandoned in the garden during the<br />
summer and lay almost completely buried, with only a bit of one corner showing above ground, which<br />
is how Mrs Frisby had discovered it. It lay on its side in such a way that the solid parts of the<br />
block formed a roof and a floor, both waterproof, and the hollows made two spacious rooms. Lined <br />
with bits of leaves, grass, cloth, cotton fluff, feathers and other soft things Mrs Frisby and her<br />
children had collected, the house stayed dry, warm and comfortable all winter. A tunnel to the surface-earth<br />
of the garden, dug so that it was slightly larger than a mouse and slightly smaller than a cat's foreleg, <br />
provided access, air, and even a fair amount of light to the living room. The bedroom, formed by the second oval, <br />
was warm but dark, even at midday. A short tunnel through the earth behind the block connected the two rooms.

<div class="p3">
Although she was a widow (her husband had died only the preceding summer), Mrs Frisby was able, through luck<br />
and hard work, to keep her family - there were four children - happy and well fed. January and February were <br />
the hardest months; the sharp, hard cold that began in December lasted until March, and by February the beans <br />
and peas had been picked over (with help from the birds), the asparagus roots were frozen into stone, and the <br />
potatoes had been thawed and refrozen so many times they had acquired a slimy structure and a rancid taste. <br />
Still, the Frisbys made the best of what there was, and one way or another they kept from being hungry.
</div>

<br />

<div class="p4">
Then, one day at the very end of February, Mrs Frisby's younger son, Timothy, fell sick.<br />
That day began with a dry, bright, icy morning. Mrs Frisby woke up early, as she always did.<br />
She and her family slept close together in a bed of down, fluff, and bits of cloth they had <br />
gathered, warm as a ball of fur.
