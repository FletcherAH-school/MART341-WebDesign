# Assignment 5
## Fletcher Henderson
I don't know why it made one of my README.md files into a site instead of my html one last time

1. I went to amazon on the day I was born, the website was a lot more minimal and blocky, it was far less developed than it is now which I was expecting. I learned Monsters Inc. came out the day I was born and that was interesting. It is a lot more streamlined and “pretty” looking now.<br />
2. The last few topics haven’t been too bad, definitely a little struggle. I’m still confused with the process of  publishing a specific or multiple pages and will probably do more out of class research and schedule a meeting next week to clarify what I can’t figure out.<br />
