# Fletcher Henderson
## Final
1. Yes, I didn’t know anything and now I know a decent amount, I am very interested in<br />taking your  Web Server Tech class next semester :)<br />


2. Yes, I feel confident with time and a lil more knowledge I could make a pretty good looking <br />website <br />

3. The whole class was challenging but in a fun way, I would use reference code, chatrooms, and <br />youtube to learn what I was confused about. I'm a little unsure if these questions are about this <br />week or the whole semester so I just went with the whole semester. Over all the classes I’ve had <br />from you this semester have been my favorite so far so thank you.<br />
