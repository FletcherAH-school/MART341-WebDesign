1.Divs are a “block level element’” to group other elements, Ids <br /> give the object an identifier to be used with other things, spans are<br /> kind of like div tags but for text, classes are for grouping things<br /> that are similar<br />

2.Copyright <br />


3.I had a lot of challenges this week but I just kept trying new ways of<br /> doing things and checking for errors till it worked how I think you <br />wanted it too, I ended up using the embedded link for the audio from <br />spotify but it shows up as if it were from SoundCloud which is confusing <br />but hey it works.
