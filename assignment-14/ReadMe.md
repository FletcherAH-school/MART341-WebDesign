# Fletcher Henderson
## week 14
1. I used bootstrap<br />

2. CDN because that's just what I'm used to using<br />

3. It allows for more diverse and powerful websites <br />

4. I am pretty confused by this week, I’m not sure if I did it right. I was pretty confident about<br /> the JS because of my experience with it in other classes but I might have done that<br /> wrong but I like the little piece I made so I’m going to leave it. The stuff with bootcamp has<br /> me confused but I kind of get it,  I definitely need to work on understanding it more though.<br />
