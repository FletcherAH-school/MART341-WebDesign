# Fletcher Henderson
## Week 7
1. Usually just asking for my email so they can send me a newsletter <br />
2. Plain text, password - Radio buttons, Checkbox - Upload button, submit <br />button - all the ones I chose kind of just do exactly what they sound<br /> like they would do except Radio buttons, those “allow users to select one item”.<br />
3. This was just a very busy week for me in general so I had to go through<br /> everything faster than usual, probably going to have to come back to review.
