        <h2><div>Directions</div></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>
                Using the scale pour equal parts water, acrylic paint, and pouring medium. Repeat this for each color you<br />
                 want in your piece and vary size based on how many colors you want and how prevalent you wish each one to be.<br />
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>
                Now repeat the first step but use at least twice as much paint, water, and medium as you used in any previous color.<br /> 
                This will be your base and should be white or black depending on what you are looking for, other colors could work but <br />
                risk taking over the painting so make sure it goes with everything and is fairly neutral.<br />
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>
                Mix each cup thoroughly using the popsicle sticks. <div>OPTIONAL:</div> add a drop or two of silicon to every color but the base to increase cell count

            </span></li>
            <br />
            <img src="images/mixed.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"/>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li><span>
                After each color is mixed take another cup or container(larger if possible, if not repeat this step with multiple cups) and<br />
                gently pour the paint in layers based on your preference until the cup or cups are full. You don't have to use your base in<br />
                this process but it does help keep the colors from blending, if you choose to use your base in this step only pour very<br />
                small layers so the non base colors don't make as much contact.

            </span></li>
            <br />
            <img src="images/layered.JPG" width="50%" height="50%"/>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li><span>
                Once all your paint is layered in a cup or cups pour a decent amount of your base onto the canvas, tilt the canvas or spread<br />
                the paint to ensure the canvas is decently covered with a couple millimeters of paint (precision doesn't really matter here)<br />
                now slowly pour the layered paint onto the base, this can be done by holding the cup in one spot and letting it all fall and<br />
                push from one spot which will make a more circular pattern or you can move the cup around while pouring(again precision doesn't<br />
                really matter that much just don't go crazy) 
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <img src="images/resting.JPG" width="50%" height="50%"/>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li><span>
                Now very lightly pass the torch or heat gun over the paint to release bubbles but be careful not to burn any paint, keep it fast<br /> 
                and distant especially if you are using a torch.
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>
                Finally let the paint rest very briefly (2-3 minutes) before picking up your canvas and tilting it to fill the space and stretch <br />
                out or remove certain designs that formed. During this a lot of paint will fall off the canvas just be careful you don't want everything<br />
                to fall off, just enough that the whole thing is covered and you are happy with the result.
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>
                Now cover and let dry somewhere that it won't get stuck due to the excess paint that will drip from it for about 24 - 36 hours and <br />
                you did it!
            </span></li>

        </ul>
