# Fletcher Henderson
## Week 9
1.This week I used a lot of what I learned last week, so with that in<br /> mind it was pretty easy this week but last week was really hard.<br />

2.I’m not anxious or excited about anything in particular but when learning<br /> new code I am usually both because of how difficult it can be and what I’ll <br />be able to do after.<br />

3.This week was just kind of fun, nothing crazy. Hardest part was deciding<br /> what project to do.<br />
