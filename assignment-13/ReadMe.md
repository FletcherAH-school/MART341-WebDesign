# Fletcher Henderson
## week 12
1. I couldn't think of anything so I wrote “Business and Co.” and some stock images, only<br />ones with water marks because I think that’s funny. Then I thought what if the business<br /> just had a bunch of employes you could hire for stock images/ extras in commercials so<br />I went with that, I made sure to word things strangely as well to add to the mystery<br />


2. Make things compatible to begin with, make it easy to navigate, keep it simple <br />

3. The biggest challenge for me this week was managing such a large project <br />
( in comparison to the ones so far)
